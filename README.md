### Setup For database
Connected database to singlestore, setup by changing stuff in the .env file, so we can connect to database.

Then went and added it to env.js for easy access. Modified the drizzle config for ORM setup, and modified schema for simple testing if it works.

#### TODO from here
- update need to update schema for files and folders
- manually insert examples
